## Approach ##

**1.	Customer Segmentation (Clustering):** 

•	Utilize clustering algorithms to group customers based on their banking behaviours, transaction histories, and demographics. 

**2.	Credit Risk Assessment (Classification):** 

•	Develop a robust credit scoring system using classification algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants. 
•	Utilize historical data to train the model and predict the likelihood of default or late payments. 
•	Enhance risk management by integrating machine learning models into the credit approval process. 

**3.	Performance Prediction (Regression):**

•	Build regression models to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for the banking institution, such as asset growth, revenue, and profitability. 
•	Analyze the impact of various factors, such as economic indicators and market trends, on the bank's performance. 
•	Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, investment strategies, and overall business performance.
